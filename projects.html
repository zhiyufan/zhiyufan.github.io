      <p>Zhiyu's research interest has been focused on the intersections of automated program repair, automatic programming, and computer science education. His research work on program repair for intelligent tutoring (<a href="files/TOSEM2022.pdf">TOSEM22</a>, <a href="files/ISSTA2023.pdf">ISSTA23</a>, program repair of AI programs (<a href="files/ICSE2023.pdf">ICSE23</a>), explorations on AI (i.e. LLM) programming (<a href="files/ISSTA2024b.pdf">ISSTA24a, ISSTA24b</a>) have been published in top-tier software engineering venues. His has led the development of <a href="projects.html">Intelligent Tutoring System</a> to boost Computer Science education at scale via SE and LLM techniques, which has been deployed in NUS.

      <p>In addition to the research projects, we also pursuit realistic impact in Computer Education and Teaching. We have built an Intelligent Tutor System (ITS) that integrates all above research outcomes throughout a new and novel Software Engineering course (<a href="https://cs3213-fse.github.io">CS3213 Foundations of Software Engineering</a>) and deployed it in NUS to facilitate programming teaching (<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05472">Experience on ITS, arXiv 2023</a>). We are still actively evolving the ITS for next generation Computer Education!
